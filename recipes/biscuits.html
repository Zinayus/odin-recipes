        <h1>Brian's Almost Famous Almost Buttermilk Biscuits</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This biscuit recipe was developed after years of trial and error and was developed by combining the best parts of numerous recipes and techniques over those years.  The result is a batch of 8-10 fluffy and delicious southern "Buttermilk" biscuits.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Cups flour (I prefer Wheat Montana)</li>
                <li>1 Cup Milk</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp White Vinegar</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp Baking Powder</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp Cream of Tartar</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp Baking Soda</li>
                <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
                <li>1 Egg lightly beaten</li>
                <li>5 Tbsp Butter cut into cubes</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees</li>
            <li>In a small bowl mix together milk and vinegar and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl mix all of the dry ingredients.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry cutter, two knives, or a fork cut in the butter until the butter is the size of large peas (roughly the size of the end of your pinky finger).</li>
            <li>Mix in the milk and egg until the flour has been incorporated (do not over mix because it will result in dense biscuits).</li>
            <li>Pour the dough out onto a floured surface and fold/kneed about 3 times and then roll out to about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Using a cup, 2 inch cookie cutter, or other device cut biscuits to desired size out of the dough and place on a cookie sheet with the sides touching.</li>
            <li>Put the cookie sheet with the biscuits in the preheated oven and bake for 13-15 minutes or until the tops are golden brown.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Half way through cooking brush the tops with butter (This will help make the tops a little more flaky).</li>
        </ol>
