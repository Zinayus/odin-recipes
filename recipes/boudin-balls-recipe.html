        <h1>All Recipes Boudin Balls Recipe by Chef John</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>The textural contrast between the crispy outside and moist, savory inside is a wonder to behold. The taste is just as impressive. Intensely flavorful and satisfying, these boudin balls would win any Big Game food table on which they appeared. Hint, hint. Serve with remoulade sauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ¾ pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
                <li>6 ounces chicken livers, rinsed and trimmed</li>
                <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
                <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
                <li>1/2 cup diced poblano pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 cup seeded and diced jalapeno pepper</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked white rice, or more to taste</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped green onion</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
                <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir pork shoulder, livers, onion, celery, poblano pepper, jalapeno pepper, garlic, kosher salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons ground black pepper, chili powder, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a large pot. Cover the pot with a lid and refrigerate until flavors combine, 2 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Pour enough water into the pork mixture to cover by 2-inches; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from heat. Pour mixture through a strainer, reserving strained liquid and meat separately.</li>
            <li>Transfer drained meat mixture to a cutting board and finely chop.</li>
            <li>Stir chopped meat, rice, parsley, and green onion together in a bowl. Gradually add reserved cooking liquid, 1 ladleful at a time, to meat mixture, stirring until completely incorporated between each addition, until mixture has a paste-like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Roll chilled meat mixture into 1-inch balls.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, 1 pinch cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a shallow bowl. Pour breadcrumbs into another shallow bowl. Beat eggs in another shallow bowl.</li>
            <li>Gently press 1 ball into flour mixture to coat; shake off the excess flour. Dip ball into the beaten egg; press ball into bread crumbs. Place breaded ball onto a plate and repeat breading process with remaining meat balls.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, cook boudin balls in preheated oil, turning once, until crispy on the outside and hot on the inside, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
